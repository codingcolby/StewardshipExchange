# Stewardship Exchange

## Description

Duration: 2 week sprint

The STEWARDSHIP EXCHANGE is a free online resource for cultural heritage agencies to share surplus preservation and conservation material for collections care. Repositories typically have a surplus of new or gently used enclosures, supplies, tools, equipment, and furnishings that still have a useful life. Reducing, reusing, recycling, and repurposing helps save precious budget dollars for these non-profit organizations. This site aims to provide a communication forum for the collections care community to offer and claim these materials and as a by-product, foster new relationships, expanding professional networks. Registered users can create new offers, edit their offers, and create an Exchange Story to celebrate a successful transaction.
